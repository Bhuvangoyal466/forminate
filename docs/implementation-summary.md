## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create `.env.local` from `.env.example`:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/forminate
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Initialize Database
```bash
node scripts/init-db.js
```

### 4. Start Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test User Account
- **Email**: test@forminate.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Plan**: Pro (for testing all features)

### Test Workflow
1. **Sign up/Sign in** with test account
2. **Create a form** with different question types
3. **Publish the form** and get public URL
4. **Fill out the form** as an end user
5. **View responses** in the dashboard
6. **Check analytics** and statistics

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Database Setup
1. Set up **MongoDB Atlas** or self-hosted MongoDB
2. Configure connection string in environment
3. Run database initialization script

### Security Configuration
1. Generate strong **JWT secret** (minimum 32 characters)
2. Configure **CORS** for your domain
3. Set up **rate limiting** appropriate for your traffic
4. Configure **file upload** limits and storage

### Performance Optimization
1. **Database indexing** is pre-configured
2. **API pagination** prevents large data transfers
3. **Rate limiting** prevents abuse
4. **Optimized queries** for analytics

## üìä Analytics & Insights

### Form-Level Analytics
- **View counts** and unique visitors
- **Submission rates** and completion percentages
- **Drop-off analysis** by question
